# BOGGLEBOARD PROJECT - Version 1 (21 September 2017)

## Task

We were asked to build the Boggleboard game with the following instructions.

## Synopsis

Boggleboard Boggle is a simple game, but when you get down into it there are some subtleties.

Model the first part of the game, where you place the Boggle dice and shake them around to create the initial board, which will be 4 x 4 blank spaces.

Then model the dice. Think carefully about how shaking a Boggle board works. Each die lands in one and only one cell, with one side facing up. Here's a list of Boggle dice, with "Q" representing "Qu":

AAEEGN
ELRTTY
AOOTTW
ABBJOO
EHRTVW
CIMOTU
DISTTY
EIOSST
DELRVY
ACHOPS
HIMNQU
EEINSU
EEGHNW
AFFKPS
HLNNRZ
DEILRX

Next, assume we want "Qu" to be printed rather than "Q". You'll probably want to change how the board is printed, too, since "Qu" will throw everything out of alignment.

## Further Work

Boggleboard version 2 should model a person checking whether a given word is on the Boggle board or not.
